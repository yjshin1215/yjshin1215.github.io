						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Although I had been aware of the of the color contrast standards and their importance when it comes to accessibility, I had no idea that there were other ways to ensure it! In particular, I liked learning about the focus state contrasts. It's a way to provide accessibility for a user that is interacting with the product for perhaps a longer period of time, which is always going to be useful! </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was that they provided a strong foundation as to why accessibility is important, and the status quo of accessibility-related laws. It went through both the ethical and legal aspects of accessibility in design, which I know are both valid and important things to consider for designers. The fact that they included a lot of external links was helpful for me too. </p>
