					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I had heard about the Gestalt principles before, but I had never fully grasped what they were. I learned that there were several principles, and what they were respectively. Even though I am interested in human psychology, I didn't know psychology principles could be directly applied to design. I found that super helpful to know! </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was seeing all the example images of different gestalt principles. I liked that the images started from something as simple as a dalmatian, to website pages with principles applied to them. Additionally, it was super useful to read the explanations as to how they applied to UX design! </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "User Interface Design isn’t all about pretty pixels and sparkly graphics. It’s mainly about communication, performance and convenience." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
