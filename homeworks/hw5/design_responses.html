                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I learned the many different ways you can use animation to enhance a UI design! I learned that there are way more possible interactive elements than simply items showing up when you scroll them. It was sad that I couldn't really learn how to make these animations through the article though! </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I just loved looking at all the different examples. The complex animations put me at awe and got me excited about the potential to design sites like them myself. It also scared me a little bit to be honest, since it looks kind of complex! </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> The Nike example was one of my favorites! The animation where the shoe size grew in size as you slid up the size selection element just made a lot of intuitive sense. Additionally, the animation when you do the "back" gesture was also very aesthetically pleasing. I wonder if it was a bit overkill though, and if the animation could perhaps take away from the interface's goal to convey information accurately/digestibly. </p>
