				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I learned what Dark Patterns in UI/UX means, and how prevalent it is in industry. I also learned about the different kinds of Dark Patterns, and examples of them in real-life websites. One example—Coursera—stood out to me because I had used the website before, but this pattern had never stood out to me. I appreciated this new-found eye to spot Dark Patterns. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I liked the part that addressed the "Roach Motel." I was familiar (and very frustrated) with this tactic but did not know that there was a name for it. Not only do I love this name, but I think it's important to be aware of this Dark Pattern.  </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "Campbell-Dollaghan (Fast Co. Design, 2017) also talks about Facebook’s NewsFeed algorithm. The algorithm is designed to serve new stories, both true and false, to users depending on their observed opinion."</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
