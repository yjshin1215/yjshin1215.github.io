            <li>I learned a useful trick to help my design thinking. I hadn't paid much attention to how the apps I use are laid out, and I thought it would actually be useful to keep this in mind!</li>
            <li>I loved how the article gave relatable examples like Airbnb & Spotify. I could follow along with the observations and understand the thought process behind this exercise!</li>
            <li>Favorite Quote: "Open an app you use often and resist the urge to start scrolling through content. Instead, I want you to actively focus on the screen in front of you."</li>
