					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned so many facts about animation that I didn't know before! For example, I didn't know there was an optimal time for animation speeds, and that it differed based on the size of the screen you're seeing it on! I also hadn't considered sizing of an element and the required animation speed, but it makes a lot of sense now! </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I loved the numerous examples that the article provided. Having a visual indication of what different animations looked like helped me get a grip of how to apply animations better. The examples with the motion blur was especially interesting! </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "But do not forget that animation is more of an art than science, so itâ€™s better to experiment and test your decisions on users." </p>
						</li>
